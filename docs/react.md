# React

React itself is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mainly for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React allows you to design simple views for each state in your application, and it will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

## Node

**`npm`** stands for Node Package Manager, and it is the default package manager for the Node.js runtime environment. Its two main functionalities are to allow developers to share packaged modules of code and to manage dependencies and versions of these packages in a Node.js project.

**`npx`** is a tool that was introduced with npm version 5.2.0. It is a package runner tool that comes with npm. It makes it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the npm registry.

## D3.js

D3.js is a JavaScript library that excels in manipulating the DOM based on data. The "D3" in D3.js stands for "Data-Driven Documents" which encapsulates its main purpose: **bind data to the DOM and then apply transformations to the document.**

Here is a basic process of how D3.js uses data to manipulate the DOM and draw a scatter plot:

1. **Data Join:** D3.js binds data to existing DOM elements, or creates new elements in their absence. For instance, for creating a scatter plot, we would bind an array of data to circle elements in an SVG container.
2. **Enter Selection**: For each data point, if there is no existing DOM element, D3.js creates a new one. In a scatter plot, this might mean creating a new circle SVG element for each new data point.**
3. **Update Selection**: This is where the actual transformations happen based on the data. For example, setting the cx and cy attributes of each circle element to position it according to the data point it's bound to. 
4. **Exit Selection**: Any DOM elements that are not associated with data are removed. In a scatter plot, this might mean removing circle elements if the new dataset has fewer data points.


In contrast, React uses a concept called a **virtual DOM**. 
Instead of directly manipulating the DOM like D3.js, it creates a copy of the DOM in memory â€” the virtual DOM. When the state of a React component changes, it first makes changes to the virtual DOM. Then it compares (diffs) the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and finds the minimal number of operations required to update the actual DOM to match the virtual DOM.
